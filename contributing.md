# Contributing

As an open source project, we welcome all contributors. Contributors shall abide by the policies described in the [Code of Conduct](Code_of_Conduct.md) and adopt the following protocol for contributing:

* Log issues and engage in constructive discussion within the [issue tracker](/Issues)
* To volunteer to work on an issue (either independently or in collaboration), assign yourself to the issue and follow the steps:

    1. Create a feature branch with a concise 1-3 word name that adopts `snake_case` formatting
    2. Commit discrete steps in resolving the issue with concise but descriptive commit messages. Any commit that completes resolving an issue should use [GitHub keywords for automating closing the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (e.g. "Adds main menu, **closes #1**). If anyone made meaningful contributions to the work (such as participating in pair programming), credit them with a mention in the commit message (e.g. "Correct segfault error; @username contributed") and they should be added as an "Assigned to" contributor if they are not already.
    3. Push your changes to your feature branch and create a Pull Request. If your Pull Requests does not pass automated checks and/or contains unresolved conflicts, the person who submitted the PR is expected to address the problems before the PR will be reviewed.
    4. A minimum of two other team members will review the Pull Request and provide discussion and/or constructive feedback. Engage in communication within the Issue comments.
    5. If at least two other team members have reviewed and approved the Pull Request, it will be merged into the `main` branch using **Rebase and Merge**, unless the commits are too granual (according to the concensus of the reviewers) in which case **Squash and Merge** will summarize the commits into a single commit.
    6. Once the Pull Request has been accepted and merged, the feature branch should be deleted from the repository
